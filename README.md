Hello! <br>
Before we begin, please note that this script is compatible only with phones with Root, (you can check whether the phone has been rooted using the Root Checker app). <br>
The script converts user-level security credentials to system-level credentials. <br>
<br>
How to use a script: <br>
1. First ADB must be installed on the computer. <br>
2. After that, install a user-level security certificate, and download the script. <br>
3. Finally, connect your phone to the computer with ADB Debugging mode enabled, and run the script. <br>
<br>
Good luck and good day!
